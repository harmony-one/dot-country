1. Implement an admin batch minting (initialization/registration) function in BaseRegistrarImplementation that can be only called once, similar to [https://github.com/harmony-one/dot-country/blob/eee6967b4a51589da0d6d22dbde61b8a928ee3e8/contracts/contracts/DC.sol#L93](https://github.com/harmony-one/dot-country/blob/eee6967b4a51589da0d6d22dbde61b8a928ee3e8/contracts/contracts/DC.sol#L93) 
2. Implement uri method point to MetadataService in BaseRegistrarImplementation
3.
